# Setup & Usage

To setup a DPP Proxy service, you need to run the service at a domain name which points to a host with an SSL certificate, and then set the environment variables for it in the DPP Proxy service and in the basic wallet which is to utilize that host for DPP.&#x20;

In the DPP Proxy itself:

{% code title="docker-compose.yaml" %}
```yaml
...
dpp-proxy:
   environment:
       SERVER_HOST: yourdomain.tld
       # replace with domain pointed at your dpp-proxy service
...
```
{% endcode %}

In the [Wallet](../wallet/) which uses the proxy:

{% code title="docker-compose.yaml" %}
```yaml
...
payd:
   environment:
       DPP_HOST: wss://yourdomain.tld/ws
       # replace with domain pointed at your dpp-proxy service
...
```
{% endcode %}

Whenever an invoice is generated by the wallet, a new web socket channel is established on the DPP Proxy service, which then allows the proxy to route messages received concerning that particular `id` to the appropriate client.

### Testing Service

We run a public DPP Proxy you can use for testing by setting your payd DPP\_HOST to:

`wss://infra.bitcoinsv.io/dpp/ws`

### Usage

To use a DPP Proxy, simply include the host name in your payToURL when requesting payment from someone. For example:&#x20;

_Please pay me at: **https://infra.bitcoinsv.io/dpp/api/v1/payment/u58gbyFP**_

You could encode that URL as a QR code, and we arrive at an experience quite familiar to most.
